# State-machine-for-candy-vending-machine-in-VHDL

This project is a candy vending machine in VHDL, a digital system that can be modeled and implemented using the VHDL hardware description language. The VHDL code can be used to create a simulation of the vending machine, as well as to program a digital device such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to control the physical vending machine. The VHDL code for the candy vending machine would likely include a state machine to keep track of the current state of the vending machine, such as whether it is idle, dispensing candy, or out of candy. The code would also include logic to handle input from the user, such as button presses to select a candy and insert money, as well as logic to control the dispensing mechanism and handle output, such as displaying the amount of money inserted and the available candy options. The VHDL project was tested with the simulation process in 'ModelSim', so now is ready to be implemented on FPGA or ASIC to operate on real vending machine.
